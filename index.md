# Supratik Banerjee

## Introduction 
Hi! I My name is Supratik but people call me **Sup**.\
It is pronouced as "**_soup_**".

It may sound weird but for the lack of time I would randomly like to _quote_ my favourite scientist **Richard Feynmann** from his biography _What do you care what other people think?_
>I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. 

This quote resonates with me as my dad was very much like his dad. Here is a random picture of me and him(my dad not Feynmann unfortunately) since this makes me feel a little nostalgic.

In fact my interest in CS peaked because of feynmann.
My first line of code was

```
print("hello world")
```

Here are 3 random facts about me:
